# Lesion skin cancer segmentation
### Based on the ISIC 2018 challenge which goal was to create automated predictions of lesion segmentation boundaries within dermoscopic images.

## Image segmentation  
Segmentation is performed using U-Net Convolutional Neural Network. 

### Best results on the test set are: Accuracy 95.1%, Jaccard score 80.8%, Sensitivity 86.8%, Specifitivity 97.4%
With parameters:
- image size: 256x256
- batch size: 8
- epochs: 70 (Early Stopping patience=10)
- feature channels configuration: [32,64,128,256,512]
- optimizer: adam
- loss: binary_crossentropy
- preprocessing: [augumentations, histogram equalization, per-channel normalization]

## Image Pre-Processing
### Challenges:
* vignette
* ink markings
* scale rulers
* skin lines
* blood vessels
* hair

### Common techniques
* color space transformation, grayscale convertion
* contrast enchancement, histogram equalization
* per-channel mean normalization
* gaussian blur
* data augumentation (horiz/vert flip, zoom, rotation, offset)
* ZCA
* connected components


### Pre-processings currently implemented
1. Resize image to a constant computable dimension (e.g. 512x512)  
1. Convert image to grayscale to reduce image dimension and match format of orginal U-Net reference  
1. Contrast enchancement  
    This ensures images have consistent contrast between neighbouring areas and RoI. It will be accomplished by first calculating the histogram of grayscale image. The top 2% of histogram intensities were then selected and used as cut off values. Histogram then stretches to remap the darkest pixel to 0 and lightest to 255 against the selected cut off thresholds.  
1. Per-channel mean normalization
1. Data augumentation 
1. ZCA whitening
1. Connected components
